# RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT
## GAME INTRODUCTION
**RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT** is a game popularized by *Squid Game* - a South Korean television series. 
The primary logic of the game revolves around the concept that any players moving when the "red light" is called is shot dead on the spot. 
The game requires caution, careful calculation, and precise timing. I've enhanced it with different levels.
