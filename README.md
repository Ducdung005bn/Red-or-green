# RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT

## GAME INTRODUCTION
**RED LIGHT, GREEN LIGHT** is a game popularized by *Squid Game* - a South Korean television series. 
The primary logic of the game revolves around the concept that any players moving when the "red light" is called is shot dead on the spot. 
The game requires caution, careful calculation, and precise timing. I've enhanced it with different levels.

+ In the top right-hand corner of the main menu appears the number of coins you have.
  
You can select options here (they will stand out if you move the mouse cursor to them). 

+ If you haven't got access to the game before, select "Instructions" to know how to play the game. Press the arrow keys on your keyboard to scroll up and down the page. 
+ Select "Shop" to enter the shop, where you can buy new clothes to upgrade your level.
+ Select "Start game" or "Last stand" to enter the play area. "Last stand" differs from "Start game" in the fact that if you win the last stand, you are recognized to completely crack this game (it is the last round). 

At the beginning, you have no coins and are at level 1. You need to earn coins and upgrade your level.

## 2. Upgrade your level
### a. There are 4 levels.
At levels 1, 2 and 3, the goal is to reach the finish line before time's up without getting eliminated.

#### LEVEL 1
+ When starting playing, you stand on the starting line. 
+ Please press the arrow keys on your keyboard to move. 
+ As the giant doll sings showing her back to you, the light will be green, meaning you are allowed to run towards the finish line. 
+ When she stops singing, the light will turn red, so you will have to stop running. If you are caught moving, you will be shot dead on the spot by a group of masked guards in pink jumpsuits. 
+ Additionally, you are required to cross the finish line within a time limit. If time's up and you haven't reached the finish line, you'll still get shot. Therefore, pay attention to the "Time Remaining" written at the top of the screen. 
+ If you reach the finish line before time's up without getting eliminated, the sooner you reach the finish line, the more coins you are given.

#### LEVEL 2
+ The primary logic of level 2 is basically the same as that of level 1.
+ Additionally, there is one character called "Follower". Its duty is to follow you (it can move only when the light is green). Watch out for the follower, because you'll also be shot if at the same position as it.

#### LEVEL 3
+ The only difference between level 2 and level 3 is that there will be two followers instead of one.
+ You need to move extremely carefully to be able to cross the finish line. 

#### LEVEL 4
+ This is the last round, where you are disguised as the giant doll.
+ There are 15 automated players. They will try to reach the finish line without being caught moving. Of cource, they don't know when the light will turn red.
+ You're required to choose when to turn the red light (please press the space key). You just have only 3 times to turn it.
+ If any automated players reach the finish line before time's up without getting eliminated, you will lose. On the contrary, you will win.
